# About

This mod builds upon Croptopia to improve the food experience for Minecraft players.  
It is built using Fabric Loader & API and runs on Minecraft 1.17 _only_.

Utopia has many unique features:
1. Realism (in development):
    - Rot and overdue
    - Food tooltips
    - Patches to cover food from Minecraft, Croptopia and (TBD) Sandwichable
    - Salt and fridges to reduce rot and overdue speeds
    - Custom effects when the food is eaten 
    - Permanent food effects
    - Randomly applied / always applied food effects
2. Furniture (Planned)
3. Building (Planned)
4. Cooking (Planned)
5. Exploration (Planned)
6. Campaign (Future steps for Utopia 2.0)
