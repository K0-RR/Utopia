# About

This mod builds upon Croptopia to improve the food experience for Minecraft players.  
It is built using Fabric Loader & API and runs on Minecraft 1.17.1 _only_.

Utopia has many unique features:
1. Realism (in development):
    - Rot and overdue
    - Food tooltips
    - Patches to cover food from Minecraft, Croptopia and (optional) Sandwichable
    - Salt and fridges to reduce rot and overdue speeds
2. Furniture (Planned)
3. Building (Planned)
4. Cooking (Planned)
5. Exploration (Planned)

# Install

The releases (and pre-releases) of this mod are available via the [MiniManager tool](https://github.com/RedGrapefruit09/MiniManager).\
Download the installer for your OS, run it, then run the app and click on `Download` in the `Utopia` section.\
The files will be in your folder of choice.

# Code

The code is mainly written in Kotlin 1.5.21, except for mixins, which are written in Java 16.
I try to comment and document the code as much as I can to ensure readability.  
Any refactoring and cleanup suggestions are welcome!

# Contribute

Any contributions (PRs and issues) are welcome.  
All contributors will be **credited** in the mod when pressing the ```/utopia``` command in-game.
