# Support for 1.17

This mod(plugin) is being updated to support 1.17, and it is currently in **beta**.  
Here's the list of things to do for full support:

- [x] Update to 1.17 Fabric and Minecraft version
- [x] Resolve the compile errors
- [x] Resolve the runtime errors
- [x] Use Croptopia 1.17-rc2
- [x] Use Patchouli snapshot release for 1.17
- [ ] Wait for Croptopia to fully update
- [ ] Wait for Patchouli to fully update

Most things are finished, but not all the dependencies have updated to 1.17  
(for Croptopia, we use the 1.17-rc2 version, for Patchouli, we use the snapshot version).  
Even though **the mod is working**, the support cannot be considered stable until the dependencies update.

# About
This is plugin for [Croptopia](https://github.com/ExcessiveAmountsOfZombies/Croptopia).  
The plugin is in early stages of development and definitely not ready yet.  
The name ```plugin``` means that the mod requires Croptopia (and a few other dependencies) to run.  
The aim of this project is to expand Croptopia's functionality with many new items, blocks, biomes, structures etc.

# Features

#### Module system
The mod is split into 5 modules, each containing unique features and not depending on any other module.  
Modules can be turned on/off in ```config/utopia.modules.json```.  
Compatibility is likely to be broken when turning a module off.
