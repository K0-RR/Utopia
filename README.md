# About
This is plugin for [Croptopia](https://github.com/ExcessiveAmountsOfZombies/Croptopia).  
The plugin is in early stages of development and definitely not ready yet.  
The name ```plugin``` means that the mod requires Croptopia (and a few other dependencies) to run.  
The aim of this project is to expand Croptopia's functionality with many new items, blocks, biomes, structures etc.

# Features

#### Module system
The mod is split into 5 modules, each containing unique features and not depending on any other module.  
Modules can be turned on/off in ```config/utopia.modules.json```.  
Compatibility is likely to be broken when turning a module off.

### Realism

**About**: This module adds a whole new difficulty of using food - your food can become rotten and overdue!  
Of course, you can use salt, or a fridge (fridges are in module Furniture) to slow down the process, but now you  
really have to keep track of your food.  
**Release date**: End of June.  
**Current state**: In development, previews are available.

### Furniture

**About**: New beautiful furniture blocks to store your food in and make a wonderful kitchen!  
Some blocks have custom functionality aside from storage, like the fridge.  
**Release date**: Beginning of July.  
**Current state**: In early development, limited previews are available.

### Exploration

**About**: Discover new villages, mansions, biomes and even dimensions in the world!
