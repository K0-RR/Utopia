# About

This mod builds upon Croptopia to improve the food experience for Minecraft players.  
It is built using Fabric Loader & API and runs on Minecraft 1.17 _only_.

Utopia has many unique features:
1. Realism (in development):
    - Rot and overdue
    - Food tooltips
    - Patches to cover food from Minecraft, Croptopia and (optional) Sandwichable
    - Salt and fridges to reduce rot and overdue speeds
2. Furniture (Planned)
3. Building (Planned)
4. Cooking (Planned)
5. Exploration (Planned)
6. Campaign (Future steps for post-1.0 releases)
7. Metal Reinforcements (Future steps post-1.0 releases)

# Install

The mod hasn't released yet, but the previews/alphas/betas are publicly available on this repo.  
Go to [releases](https://github.com/RedGrapefruit09/Utopia/releases) and click on the top release.  
Download all the pinned JAR files and put them into your ```mods``` folder.  
[Fabric Language Kotlin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-language-kotlin) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) are bundled inside the main JAR, so you don't have to install them.

# Code

The code is mainly written in Kotlin 1.5.10, except for mixins, which are written in Java 16.
I try to comment and document the code as much as I can to ensure readability.  
Any refactoring and cleanup suggestions are welcome!

# Contribute

Any contributions (PRs and issues) are welcome.  
All contributors will be **credited** in the mod when pressing the ```/utopia``` command in-game.
